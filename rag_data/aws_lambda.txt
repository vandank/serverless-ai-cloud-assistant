AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code without managing servers.
It automatically scales in response to events and charges only for execution time.
Lambda supports multiple languages such as Python, Java, and Node.js.
It is commonly triggered by API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, and EventBridge.
Lambda is ideal for event-driven, microservice, and backend workloads.
